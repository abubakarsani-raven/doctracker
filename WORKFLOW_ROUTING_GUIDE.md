# How to Add People to Workflows

This guide explains how to add people (users or departments) to workflows in the document tracker system.

## Overview

Workflows can be routed to different people or departments as they progress. This is done through the **Workflow Routing** feature, which allows you to:

- Route workflows to specific individuals
- Route workflows to entire departments
- Route workflows to department heads
- Return workflows to the secretary
- Return workflows to the original sender
- Create actions from workflows

## How to Add People to a Workflow

### Step 1: Open the Workflow

1. Navigate to the **Workflows** page from the sidebar
2. Click on the workflow you want to route
3. This will open the workflow detail page

### Step 2: Access the Routing Sheet

On the workflow detail page, you'll find a **"Route Workflow"** button or similar action. Click it to open the **Workflow Routing Sheet**.

### Step 3: Choose Routing Type

The routing sheet provides several options:

#### Option 1: Route to Secretary
- Select **"Secretary"** from the routing type options
- This routes the workflow back to the secretary role
- Useful for administrative routing or returning workflows to the starting point

#### Option 2: Route to Department
- Select **"Department"** from the routing type
- Choose a department from the dropdown list
- All users in that department will be able to see and work on the workflow
- Useful for department-wide tasks or approvals

#### Option 3: Route to Individual User
- Select **"Individual"** from the routing type
- Choose a specific user from the dropdown
- The workflow will be assigned directly to that user
- Useful for specific assignments or expert reviews

#### Option 4: Route to Department Head
- Select **"Department Head"** from the routing type
- The workflow will be routed to the head of the current department
- Useful for approvals or escalation

#### Option 5: Return to Original Sender
- Select **"Original Sender"** from the routing type
- The workflow returns to the person who originally created it
- Useful for feedback loops or corrections

#### Option 6: Create Action
- Select **"Actions"** from the routing type
- This opens a dialog to create a new action from the workflow
- Actions are separate tasks that can be assigned independently

### Step 4: Add Routing Notes (Optional)

You can add notes to explain why you're routing the workflow:
- Click in the notes field
- Enter any relevant information about the routing decision
- This helps the next person understand the context

### Step 5: Confirm Routing

Click the **"Route"** or **"Send"** button to complete the routing. The workflow will be:
- Assigned to the selected person or department
- Added to the workflow's routing history
- Visible to the new assignee in their workflow list

## Understanding Workflow Participants

When you route a workflow, the system automatically tracks:

- **Routing History**: A complete log of all routing changes
- **Current Assignee**: Who the workflow is currently assigned to
- **Participants**: All people who have been part of the workflow chain

### Who Can See the Workflow?

- The **creator** (original sender) can always see the workflow
- The **current assignee** can see and work on the workflow
- **Workflow participants** (anyone in the routing history) can view the workflow
- **Department members** can see workflows assigned to their department
- **Company Admins** can see all workflows in their company
- **Master users** can see all workflows across all companies

## Cross-Company Workflows

For workflows that span multiple companies:

1. **Approval Required**: Cross-company workflows require approval before routing
2. **Select Target Company**: Choose the company you want to route to
3. **Select Target User/Department**: Choose who in that company should receive it
4. **Approval Process**: The target company admin must approve the workflow
5. **Routing**: Once approved, the workflow is routed to the selected person/department

## Best Practices

1. **Add Clear Notes**: Always add routing notes to explain why you're sending the workflow
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the person/department has appropriate access
3. **Follow the Chain**: Review routing history to understand the workflow's journey
4. **Use Actions for Complex Tasks**: For tasks that need separate tracking, create actions instead
5. **Department Routing**: Use department routing for tasks that multiple people might handle

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see the Route button"
- Check that you have permission to route workflows
- Ensure the workflow is not in a completed or cancelled state
- Verify you are the current assignee or have admin privileges

### "The person I routed to can't see the workflow"
- Check that the user has appropriate permissions
- Verify the workflow status allows viewing
- For cross-company workflows, ensure approval was granted

### "I want to add multiple people"
- Use department routing to include multiple people
- Or create actions for each person
- Note: Workflows are typically assigned to one person/department at a time

## Related Features

- **Goals**: After workflows are completed, you can create goals for follow-up tasks
- **Actions**: Create separate action items from workflows
- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications when workflows are routed to them
- **My Goals**: View all goals assigned to you across all workflows
